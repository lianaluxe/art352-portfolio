        <p><em>How might we empower people to reduce stress in their everyday lives?</em> After a lengthy brainstorming process, my teammates and I decided that this would be the design question we'd tackle for our final Interaction Design & UX project. As someone with a diagnosed anxiety disorder, I was thrilled to be working on something I might actually be able to use. I immediately started jotting down ideas for our discussion.</p>

        <h3>Our Idea</h3>
        <p>We settled on an idea for an app that uses heart rate monitor data from a user's fitness tracker to track stress levels and provide real-time assistance when it detects a sudden spike in heart rate. We decided to call our project "Juniper," inspired by the plant's soothing blue-green hue, and wanting to avoid the trope of stress reduction lifestyle apps with gimmicky names like "BetterTranquilCalmYogaZen."</p>

        <p>To start with, we created an experience map to give us a visual representation of all the app's moving parts.</p>

        <h3>Research: Survey</h3>
        <p>Next, it was time to gather some data. We created an online survey using SurveyMonkey and distributed to as many people as possible, in order to get the largest pool of data to work with. Our questions were created with specific goals, which were to find out:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the prevalence of anxiety and stress among respondents</li>
          <li>the impact on their daily lives</li>
          <li>what respondents think causes their stress</li>
          <li>the strategies they use to cope</li>
          <li>their level of interest in an anxiety tracker and virtual assistant app  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our findings were as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>93% of respondents reported feeling stressed or anxious in the past week</li>
          <li>65% reported feeling stressed/anxious “often” (35%) or “very often” (30%)</li>
          <li>75% at least somewhat agreed with the statement: “I often find that my anxiety/stress interferes with my ability to complete tasks or be productive”</li>
          <li>68% reported using breathing exercises or meditation to calm down</li>
          <li>68% said they would be “likely” (50%) or “very likely” (18%) to use an anxiety tracker and/or virtual anxiety assistant app</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research: Interviews</h3>
        <p>Next, we conducted interviews to better understand the motivations, behaviors, and needs of our potential users. Below are anonymized representations of our findings.</p>

        <p>Finally, we created a journey map based on one of our personas, Kayla, who we determined would be a "likely user" of our app.</p>

        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>At our professor's suggestion, we decided to prototype the onboarding process for the app. Our goals were to find out people’s first impressions, see if we successfully communicated the app’s purpose, see whether people would be likely to use it, and test for usability.</p>

        <h5>Paper Prototype</h5>
        <p>For our first round of prototyping, we created small, notecard-sized paper wireframes that we could use to test out our interface screens. We wanted these to be about the size of a phone screen so that our test participants could hold the prototype in their hands, to give them a more realistic experience. Buttons and other clickable components were outlined in boxes or circles.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y">
      <section class="cell small-12 large-8">
        <p>For our first round of testing, we gave our paper prototype to a a couple of classmates and asked them to interact with it like they would with a real phone's touchscreen. Afterwards, we asked them about their experiences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you think this app is for?</li>
          <li>What do you remember about it?</li>
          <li>What made things easier or harder?</li>
          <li>How did using it make you feel?</li>
          <li>Would you be likely to use something like this?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most of the feedback we received was positive: the interface made sense and was easy to use, and they would be likely to use something like it. Most people could describe the app's purpose quite well, as well as details about its functions. However, we wanted to see how this information would translate in a digital format, so we moved on to our second round of testing.</p>

        <h5>Digital Prototype</h5>
        <p>Using Figma, an online interface design tool, we created a digital version of our interactive prototype that we could easily mirror to a real smartphone for testing purposes. Daniel created a snazzy-looking logo for our splash screen, and I built out the rest of the interface and set actions for its various buttons.</p>

        <p>For this round of testing, we asked several people to use the app as if they had just downloaded it. We asked the same questions as our last test, but added a few more specific questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did the setup process make you feel? What made it simple/challenging?</li>
          <li>How did the color palette of the app make you feel?</li>
          <li>What did the emojis communicate? What makes you think that?</li>
          <li>How does the navigation work? What makes you think that?</li>

      <section class="cell small-12">
        <p>Most people seemed to have an easy time navigating through the setup process and the app itself. However, the navigation buttons confused some, and many people tried to swipe through the setup screens (which Figma unfortunately doesn't support).</p>

        <p>One person noted that the colorful emojis made the app feel more like a social media app, and so they might be less likely to trust that the app was using real heart rate data. They suggested using emojis that matched the app's color palette instead of the traditional yellow smileys, and added that being able to view heart rate data in the tracker portion of the app would add some legitimacy to it.</p>

        <h5>Final Prototype</h5>

        <p>Based on the feedback given, we made some adjustments to our prototype. The full version is viewable here: <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/juniper-prototype">bit.ly/juniper-prototype</a></strong></p>

        <p>After handing our prototype off to a few more people, the results were overwhelmingly positive.</p>

        <p>“I know it sounds silly, but [the setup screens] give me a feeling that the app cares about me.” -Test participant</p>

        <h3>Future Iteration</h3>

        <p>We're not done yet––there's still plenty left to be prototyped and tested. The next step we'd like to tackle is the diagnostic and treatment portion of the app. We've played with a few ideas, but are still working on fleshing out the details.</p>
