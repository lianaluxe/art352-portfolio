        <p>Understanding how humans interact with their environment has been an interest of mine from birth&#8212;literally. I was raised by two psychotherapists in the heart of the East Bay, who inspired in me not only the confidence to experience life deeply, but the desire to understand the experiences of others, both unique and universal.</p>
        <p>Alongside my yearning for knowledge, I formed an unadulterated passion for art and design. My childhood drawing "phase" never ended, and my need to materialize imagery as beautiful as what I saw in my mind grew as quickly as I took in inspiration. However, the physical limitations of traditional media soon became cumbersome, so I moved onto photography, and later 2D design.</p>
        <p>Together, my passions for art & design, psychology, technology, writing, critical thinking, and problem-solving spawned an infatuation with UX&#8212;finally, something that would synthesize my multitude of passions into something that has the power to change people's lives for the better.</p>
        <p>And when I'm not waxing poetic about interaction design, you can find me dancing (terribly) to techno, petting every dog in sight, or playing D&D with my squishy yet loyal party of goofballs.</p>
